    Stack Sans is a sans serif font family rooted in modernist inspiration, striking a balance between timelessness and innovation. Its distinctive notched detailing, inspired by the building process, creates a recognizable signature that is unique to Stack Sans. Crafted uniquely for Stack Overflow, Stack Sans has both a hedline and text style that allow for typographic expression regardless of scale.
